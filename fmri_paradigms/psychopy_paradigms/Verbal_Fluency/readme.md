# fMRI Paradigm for Verbal Fluency

## Paradigm Design
The paradigm has a block-design with alternating 18.2 second periods of rest and task that repeat for the duration of the fMRI data acquisition (111 measurements i.e. 299.7 seconds). The paradigm starts with a rest period i.e.:

Rest-Task-Rest-Task-...-Rest-Task

Therefore the task onsets occur at 18.2, 54.6, 91, 127.4, 163.8, 200.2, 236.6 and 273 seconds.

## Instructions
Prior to the start of data acquisition a set of instructions are displayed on the fMRI screen.

## Rest Periods
During the rest periods of the paradigm a yellow cross is displayed centrally on a black background on the fMRI screen.

## Task Periods
During the task periods of the paradigm letters, drawn at random from the English alphabet (excluding the letters H,I,J,K,Q,W,X and Y) are displayed centrally on a black background on the fMRI screen.
