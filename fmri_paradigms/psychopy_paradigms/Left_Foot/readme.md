# fMRI Paradigm for Left Foot Activations
## Paradigm DesignThe paradigm has a block-design with alternating 18.2 second periods of rest and task that repeat for the duration of the fMRI data acquisition (111 measurements i.e. 299.7 seconds). The paradigm starts with a rest period i.e.:Rest-Task-Rest-Task-...-Rest-TaskTherefore the task onsets occur at 18.2, 54.6, 91, 127.4, 163.8, 200.2, 236.6 and 273 seconds.
## InstructionsPrior to the start of data acquisition a set of instructions are displayed on the fMRI screen.
## Rest PeriodsDuring the rest periods an image of two feet with red crosses over them is displayed on the fMRI screen. The subject should keep both feet still.
## Task PeriodsDuring the task periods an image of two feet with a red cross over the right foot is displayed on the fMRI screen. The subject should wriggle the toes on their **left** foot.
