# fMRI Paradigm for Picture Naming

## Paradigm Design
The paradigm has a block-design with alternating 18.2 second periods of rest and task that repeat for the duration of the fMRI data acquisition (111 measurements i.e. 299.7 seconds). The paradigm starts with a rest period i.e.:

Rest-Task-Rest-Task-...-Rest-Task

Therefore the task onsets occur at 18.2, 54.6, 91, 127.4, 163.8, 200.2, 236.6 and 273 seconds.

## Instructions
Prior to the start of data acquisition a set of instructions are displayed on the fMRI screen.

## Rest Periods
During the rest periods of the paradigm a yellow cross or symbols are displayed, alternately for 1 second each (except 1.2s final period), centrally on a black background on the fMRI screen i.e.:

Cross-Symbols-Cross-Symbols...-Cross-Symbols

The symbols are chosen randomly from the following list:

1. */+^;@
2. |\£?:#
3. %=+|£
4. $%^£&*
5. *$&^%"
6. @?£<*)
7. +_>~#"
8. !*^£:<
9. #';/?&^
10. @-@:{)*
11. &"+`¬?.>

## Task Periods
During the task periods of the paradigm a yellow cross or objects are displayed, alternately for 1 second each (except 1.2s final period), centrally on a black background on the fMRI screen i.e.:

Cross-Objects-Cross-Objects-...-Cross-Objects

The same cross, as for the rest periods, is used.

The objects are chosen randomly from the following list:

*airplane, apple, arrow, artichoke, axe, baby, backpack, bag, ballon, ball, banana, barrel, basket, bell, belt, bench, bicycle, binoculars, bird, boat, bomb, bone, book, boot, bottle, bowl, box, boy, bread, brush, bucket, butterfly, butter, button, cake, camera, candle, car, carrot, cat, chair, cheese, cigarette, clock, clothespin, cookie, corn, dime, dog, doll, dress, drum, ear, egg, envelope, fan, faucet, feather, fence, fire, flashlight, flower, flute, football, foot, fork, frog, funnel, glasses, glass, globe, glove, guitar, hamburger, hammer, handcuffs, hand, hat, heart, helmet, horse, house, jar, ladder, lamp, leaf, lettuce, lips, lipstick, lizard, lock, magnet, mailbox, man, microphone, microscope, mouse, mushroom, necklace, needle, onion, orange, paintbrush, pan, pants, paperclip, pencil, pencilsharpener, pen, phone, piano, pig, plate, pot, present, radio, rake, robot, safe, safetypin, saw, scissors, screwdriver, shark, shirt, shoe, shovel, skateboard, skis, snake, sock, spoon, stairs, statue, stool, suitcase, sword, tape, teeth, tie, tomato, toothbrush, trumpet, umbrella, vacuum, violin, wheelbarrow, wheelchair, woman, yoyo*
