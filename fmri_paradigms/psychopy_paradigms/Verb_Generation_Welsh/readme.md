# fMRI Paradigm for Verb Generation

## Paradigm Design
The paradigm has a block-design with alternating 18.2 second periods of rest and task that repeat for the duration of the fMRI data acquisition (111 measurements i.e. 299.7 seconds). The paradigm starts with a rest period i.e.:

Rest-Task-Rest-Task-...-Rest-Task

Therefore the task onsets occur at 18.2, 54.6, 91, 127.4, 163.8, 200.2, 236.6 and 273 seconds.

## Instructions
Prior to the start of data acquisition a set of instructions are displayed on the fMRI screen.

Several languages are available (note these only affect the nouns, not the instruction page which is always in English, so you will need to explain the task to the subject separately).


## Rest Periods
During the rest periods of the paradigm a yellow cross or symbols are displayed, alternately for 1 second each (except 1.2s final period), centrally on a black background on the fMRI screen i.e.:

Cross-Symbols-Cross-Symbols...-Cross-Symbols

The symbols are chosen randomly from the following list:

1. */+^;@
2. |\£?:#
3. %=+|£
4. $%^£&*
5. *$&^%"
6. @?£<*)
7. +_>~#"
8. !*^£:<
9. #';/?&^
10. @-@:{)*
11. &"+`¬?.>

## Task Periods
During the task periods of the paradigm a yellow cross or nouns are displayed, alternately for 1 second each (except 1.2s final period), centrally on a black background on the fMRI screen i.e.:

Cross-Nouns-Cross-Nouns-...-Cross-Nouns

The same cross, as for the rest periods, is used.

The nouns are chosen randomly from the following list:

*air, ball, baton, bell, bench, bike, book, bug, basket, bed, blanket, boat, beer, bread, brick, broom, cane, cup, chair, car, carpet, cat, crayon, cigar, cloud, chess, doll, dollar, door, dog, dress, fan, finger, flag, fire, fork, food, fist, foot, gift, grape, gun, glove, gum, hammer, house, hand, horse, horn, ice, jet, juice, knife, ladder, lake, lawn, letter, milk, movie, mouse, match, money, music, mouth, needle, oar, oven, pen, paper, phone, pill, plane, pool, purse, pillow, radio, rope, ruler, razor, seed, shirt, song, stove, scale, soap, shoes, table, tree, train, towel, violin, wood, wheel, wine, water or yarn*
