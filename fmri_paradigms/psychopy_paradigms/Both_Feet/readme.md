# Motor Activations of Both Feet

## Design and Timing

The paradigm has a block-design with alternating periods of rest (18.2 seconds)

and two tasks (each 18.2 seconds long) that repeat for the duration of the 

fMRI data acquisition (164 measurements i.e. 437.9 seconds). The paradigm 

starts with a rest period i.e.:

Rest-Right Foot-Left Foot-Rest-Right Foot-Left Foot-Rest-Left Foot-Right Foot-Rest-Left Foot-Right Foot-Rest-Right Foot-Left Foot-Rest-Right Foot-Left Foot-Rest-Left Foot-Right Foot-Rest-Left Foot-Right Foot

Note: The order within each "Left Foot, Right Foot" task pair was selected at random.


## Instructions

Prior to the start of data acquisition a set of instructions are displayed on the fMRI screen. 


## Rest Periods

During the rest periods of the paradigm the following image is displayed on the fMRI screen. The subject should keep both feet still.

## Task Periods

During the task periods of the paradigm the either the left foot or right foot image is displayed on the fMRI screen as described above.
