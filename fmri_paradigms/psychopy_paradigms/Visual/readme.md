# fMRI Paradigm for Visual Activation

## Paradigm Design
The paradigm has a block-design with alternating 15.6 s second periods of rest and task that repeat for the duration of the fMRI data acquisition (103 measurements i.e. 278.1 seconds). The paradigm starts with a rest period i.e.:

Rest-Task-Rest-Task-...-Rest-Task

Therefore the task onsets occur at 15.6, 46.8, 78, 109.2, 140.4, 171.6, 202.8, 234 and 265.2 seconds.

## Instructions
Prior to the start of data acquisition a set of instructions are displayed on the fMRI screen.

## Rest Periods
During the rest periods of the paradigm a red cross is displayed centrally on a grey background on the fMRI screen.

## Task Periods
During the task periods of the paradigm there is an irregularly-timed chequerboard flash. One of the two images chequerboards are displayed on the fMRI screen for between 50 and 250 ms.
