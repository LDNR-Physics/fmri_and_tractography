# fMRI Paradigm for Left and Right Hand Activations

## Paradigm Design

The paradigm has a block-design with alternating periods of rest (18.2 seconds) and left and right hand movement (each 18.2 seconds long) that repeat for the duration of the fMRI data acquisition (164 measurements i.e. 437.9 seconds). The paradigm starts with a rest period i.e.:

Rest-Right Hand-Left Hand-Rest-Right Hand-Left Hand-Rest-Left Hand-Right Hand-Rest-Left Hand-Right Hand-Rest-Right Hand-Left Hand-Rest-Right Hand-Left Hand-Rest-Left Hand-Right Hand-Rest-Left Hand-Right Hand

Note: The order within each "Left, Right" task pair was selected at random.

## Instructions
Prior to the start of data acquisition a set of instructions are displayed on the fMRI screen.

## Rest Periods
During the rest periods an image of two hands with red crosses over them is displayed on the fMRI screen. The subject should keep both hands still.

## Task Periods
During the task periods an image of two hands with a red cross over either the left or right hand is displayed on the fMRI screen. The subject should tap the fingers on the hand as instructed.
