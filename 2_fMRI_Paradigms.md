# 2. fMRI Paradigms
## 2.1. Introduction
We recommend fMRI paradigms for testing: 
 - laterality of language activations with 
 [picture naming](#22-laterality-of-language-activations-with-picture-naming), 
 [verbal fluency](#23-laterality-of-language-activations-with-verbal-fluency) and 
 [verb generation](#24-laterality-of-language-activations-with-verb-generation)
 - motor activations of the [hands](#25-motor-activations-of-the-hands), 
 [feet](#26-motor-activations-of-the-feet) and 
 [lips](#27-motor-activations-of-the-lips)
 - sensory activations of the [hands](#28-sensory-activations-of-the-hands) and 
 [feet](#29-sensory-activations-of-the-feet)
 - [visual activations](#210-visual-activations)

>[!TIP]
>When testing the laterality of language activations we also recommend 
>measuring the subjects [handedness](#211-assessing-handedness).

## 2.2. Laterality of Language Activations with Picture Naming
### 2.2.1. Design and Timing
The paradigm has a block-design with alternating 18.2 second periods of rest 
and task that repeat for the duration of the fMRI data acquisition 
(111 measurements i.e. 299.7 seconds). The paradigm starts with a rest period 
i.e.:

Rest-Task-Rest-Task-...-Rest-Task

Therefore the task onsets occur at 18.2, 54.6, 91, 127.4, 163.8, 200.2, 236.6 
and 273 seconds.

### 2.2.2. Instructions
Prior to the start of data acquisition a set of instructions are displayed on 
the fMRI screen as shown below:
![](./fmri_paradigms/instructions_picture_naming.png)

### 2.2.3. Rest Periods
During the rest periods of the paradigm a yellow cross or symbols are 
displayed, alternately for 1 second each (except 1.2s final period), centrally 
on a black background on the fMRI screen i.e.:

Cross-Symbols-Cross-Symbols...-Cross-Symbols

The cross is shown below:
![](./fmri_paradigms/cross.png)

The symbols are chosen randomly from the following list:

1. */+^;@
2. |\£?:#
3. %=+\|£
4. $%^£&*
5. *$&^%"
6. @?£<*)
7. +_>~#"
8. !*^£:<
9. \#';/?&^
10. @-@:{)*
11. &"+`¬?.>

For example:
![](./fmri_paradigms/rest_example_symbols.png)

### 2.2.4. Task Periods
During the task periods of the paradigm a yellow cross or a picture of an object 
is displayed, alternately for 1 second each (except 1.2s final period), centrally 
on a black background on the fMRI screen i.e.:

Cross-Object-Cross-Object-...-Cross-Object

The same cross, as shown [above](#223-rest-periods), is used.

The objects are chosen randomly from this set of 
[pictures](./fmri_paradigms/picture_naming_objects).

[above](#223-rest-periods), is displayed centrally on a black background on 
the fMRI screen.

displayed, alternately for 1 second each (except 1.2s final period), centrally 
on a black background on the fMRI screen i.e.:

Cross-Nouns-Cross-Nouns-...-Cross-Nouns

The same cross, as shown [above](#223-rest-periods), is used.

The nouns are chosen randomly from the following list:

_air, ball, baton, bell, bench, bike, book, bug, basket, bed, blanket, boat, 
beer, bread, brick, broom, cane, cup, chair, car, carpet, cat, crayon, cigar,

##### 2.5.4.3. Both Hands Activation
Either the left or right hand image, chosen randomly, is shown during each 
task period. Therefore on average the subject will be instructed to tap the 
fingers of their left hand for half the number of the blocks and their right 
hand for half the number of blocks i.e. 4 blocks in total for each hand.

 toes on their left foot for half the number of the blocks and their right 
foot for half the number of blocks i.e. 4 blocks in total for each foot. 

## 2.7. Motor Activations of the Lips

## 2.8. Sensory Activations of the Hands
To test sensory activations of the hand(s) we use the same paradigm as for 
motor activations except that instead of asking the subject to tap their 
fingers a member of staff strokes the palm of the subject's hand(s).

## 2.9. Sensory Activations of the Feet
To test sensory activations of the foot/feet we use the same paradigm as for 
motor activations except that instead of asking the subject to move their 
toes a member of staff strokes the top of the subject's foot/feet.

## 2.10. Visual Activations
### 2.10.1. Design and Timing
The paradigm has a block-design with alternating 15.6 s second periods of rest 
and task that repeat for the duration of the fMRI data acquisition 
(103 measurements i.e. 278.1 seconds). The paradigm starts with a rest period 
i.e.:

Rest-Task-Rest-Task-...-Rest-Task

Therefore the task onsets occur at 15.6, 46.8, 78, 109.2, 140.4, 171.6, 202.8, 
234 and 265.2 seconds.

chequerboard flash. One of the two images shown below are displayed on the 
fMRI screen for between 50 and 250 ms.

## 2.11. Assessing Handedness
When measuring the laterality of language activations with fMRI we assess 
the subject's handedness using an
[Edinburgh Handedness Inventory](https://www.brainmapping.org/shared/Edinburgh.php) 
(EHI) created by Mark S. Cohen based on a 
[paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/0028-3932(71)90067-4) by Richard C. Oldfield.

### 2.11.1. Questionnaire
For each of the 15 activities in the 
[questionnaire](./fmri_paradigms/EHI.pdf) the subject 
is asked 

_"Which hand do you prefer to use?"_ and _"Do you ever use the other 
hand?"_

### 2.11.2. Scoring
The range of possible responses to each question are shown in the table below 
together with their respective score:

| Left | No Preference | Right | Do you ever use the other hand?| Score |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| :heavy_check_mark: |   |   |   | L=2 | 
| :heavy_check_mark: |   |   | :heavy_check_mark: | L=1 | 
|   | :heavy_check_mark: |   |   | R=1, L=1 | 
|   |   | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | R=1 | 
|   |   |   | :heavy_check_mark:  | R=2 | 

### 2.11.3. Handedness Index

The Edinburgh Handedness Index (EHI), as a percentage, is calculated using:

$EHI = \frac{R_{total} - L_{total}}{30} \times 100$%

Where $L_{total}$ is the sum of the L scores and $R_{total}$ is the sum of the 
R scores for all 15 activities.
